                <div class="faq-question">What is the Health Risk Management System?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The Health Risk Management System is a comprehensive platform that evaluates your potential health risks based on personal health parameters and helps you find suitable hospitals that accept your insurance policy. It also allows you to compare different insurance policies and generates detailed health reports for your reference.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How does the risk score evaluation work?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The risk score evaluation uses machine learning algorithms trained on both Kaggle datasets and custom-collected data. It analyzes the information you provide about your lifestyle habits, medical history, and family chronic disease history to calculate a risk score that indicates your potential for developing certain health issues.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What parameters are used to calculate my risk score?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Three main parameters are used:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lifestyle habits (such as diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption)</li>
                        <li>Medical history (past illnesses, surgeries, current conditions)</li>
                        <li>Family chronic disease history (hereditary conditions and diseases among close relatives)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How accurate is the risk score prediction?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The risk score is based on statistical models trained on extensive datasets. While it provides a good indication of potential health risks, it should be used as a screening tool rather than a definitive medical diagnosis. Always consult healthcare professionals for proper medical advice.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What datasets were used to develop the risk assessment model?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The model was trained using:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Public healthcare datasets from Kaggle</li>
                        <li>Custom datasets collected through Google Forms surveys</li>
                    </ul>
                    These datasets contain anonymized health information that helps the system identify patterns and correlations between lifestyle factors and health outcomes.

            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How does the hospital visualization feature work?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The system uses Tableau, a business intelligence tool, to visualize hospitals in your residing city that accept your insurance policy. The visualization displays relevant information such as hospital locations, specialties, ratings, and covered services under your policy.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What BI tools are used for hospital visualization?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Tableau is the primary business intelligence tool used for visualizing hospital data and insurance coverage information. It processes custom datasets uniquely fetched for each city in association with the presence of insurance policy companies.

            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How is the custom dataset for hospital information updated?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The hospital dataset is custom-built and regularly updated by collecting information directly from hospitals and insurance providers. This ensures that you receive the most current information about hospital services and insurance coverage.
